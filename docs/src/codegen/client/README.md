# Client User Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to use and
configure [`smithy4rs`](https://github.com/mellemahp/smithy4rs) code
generators to generate Rust clients (SDKs) from a Smithy model.

```admonish warning
SDK code generation is not supported at this time, but is planned.

To provide input on the development of SDK codegen please create
an issue or discussion on the [main repo](https://github.com/mellemahp/smithy4rs)
```
