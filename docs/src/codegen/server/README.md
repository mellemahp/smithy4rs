# Server User Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to use and 
configure [`smithy4rs`](https://github.com/mellemahp/smithy4rs) code 
generators to generate Rust server stubs from a Smithy model.

```admonish warning
Server-stub code generation is not supported at this time. 

To provide input on the development of server codegen please create
